- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] Unsure

**10. Is there a subject-matter expert available to answer technical questions during development?**  
_(Note: AI tools like ChatGPT are not a substitute.)_

- [ ] No

**11. Do you have users willing to help test the widgets and provide feedback during development?**  
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

**12. Do you have people willing to maintain or update the code/documentation after the initial prototype is complete?**  
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] Unsure
